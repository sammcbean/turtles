    <p><br>There are 7 different species of sea turtles.Six out of the seven are called Green, Hawksbill, Kemp's ridley, Leatherback, Loggerhead, and the Olive Ridley<br> can be found throughout the ocean - in both warm and cool waters. The seventh species, the Flatback, lives only in Australia!! However, mama turtles give<br> birth to hundreds of eggs at a time, it is hard to find a population because male and young sea turtles. Sea turtles spend most of their lives in the water, where<br> not much information can be gathered on their behavior. Most of what is known about sea turtle behavior is obtained by observing hatchlings and females<br>that leave the water to lay eggs. Turtles are pretty cool!!</p>
